# Running the application

### In order to run the application you will need the following tools:
[Java JDK 11](https://www.oracle.com/br/java/technologies/javase/jdk11-archive-downloads.html) or newer  

[SpringToolSuite IDE 4 Eclipse version](https://spring.io/tools) (you may be able to run the solution using another IDE such as Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA or Visual Studio Code, but it's strongly recommended that you use STSTool4)  

[Postman API Client](https://www.postman.com/product/api-client/) (not required, just good for testing)  

[MySql](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/) (version 10.4.22-MariaDB is recommended, because is the one that I used)  

**Tip:** make mysql installation easier and quicker by using [Xampp](https://www.apachefriends.org/pt_br/index.html)  


### Starting the aplication:
Assuming that you installed all needed softwares, we can now proceed to executing the application:

#### 1. Clone the project from github using "git clone"
#### 2. Start your MySql instance
#### 3. Start Spring Tool Suite and import the project using the following path: *File -> Import -> Maven -> Existing Maven Projects*
![Spring Tool Suite - import project](https://i.imgur.com/sW64Gev.png)
#### 3.  Open the file */fleets-manager-api/src/main/resources/application.properties* and setup your MysSql connection credentials
![Spring Tool Suite - configuring db credentials](https://i.imgur.com/qFEfaY6.png)
#### 4.  Now all you need to do is run the application by doing the following: 
![Spring Tool Suite - starting app](https://i.imgur.com/hXovJpr.png)

#### And *voil√†*! Now the application should be up and running. Now you can start to use the endpoints

## Using the application's functionalities
1. You can ddd pilots and their ships to the system by using these endpoints: **POST /pilots; POST /ships**
2. Publish transport contracts by using this endpoint: **POST /contracts**
3. Freely travel between planets by using this endpoint: **PUT /travel/from/:idFrom/to/:idTo/withpilot/:idPilot**
4. List open contracts by using this endpoint: **GET /contracts/open**
5. Accept transport contracts by using this endpoint: **PUT /contracts/accept/:id**, then you can execute it using the endpoin **PUT /contracts/execute/:id** and the system will make the travel right away and grant credits to the pilot.
6. Register a refill of the fuel using the endpoint: **PUT /ships/refuel/:id**.
7. Generate reports using the endpoints: **GET /reports/weightmovimentation**, **GET /reports/pilotspercentages** and **GET /reports/transactions**


## Notes
1. Every time that the application is started the database is recreated, you can change it at */fleets-manager-api/src/main/resources/application.properties*.
2. The file  */fleets-manager-api/src/main/resources/import.sql* is loaded every time that the system is started and placeholder data is inserted in the database, if it doesn't load automatically for you, you can run it manually.


**That's all, folksüòÅ!**
